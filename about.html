                  <h2>About FOVEA</h2>
                </header>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h3> How was FOVEA born?</h3></br>
                    <blockquote>
                        Even though Maud has always actively used her brain and developed her technique to craft the best jewerly, she had not made the great leap toward production and sales of her creations. </br></br>
                        It is only in 2016, a few years back, that she teamed up with Jacques. Together, they first started diversifying the range of items they could craft, and following up in 2017, they naturally decided to start producing for other people. </br></br>
                        For a long time, they only made items for friends and family. And everybody was so pleased! Importantly, for each item offered to their relatives, they would get positive (and negative!) feedbacks on how was the item. This ensured the continuous improvements in the products' designs. </br></br>
                        When realizing people's enthusiasm toward their creations, they started working following a more professional approach. A crafting roadmap was thoroughly optimized for each item of their collection. A complete inventory of supplies and suppliers was progressively put together. From there, the last step was to put in on display for everyone to see it! </br></br>
                        Sooner than they thought, they built a whole set of resources enabling them to start selling their products! The last step was to build a platform for sales. To ensure safe and easy transactions, FOVEA decided to start selling on Etsy first. Eventually, they are planning on developing their own independant sales website. </br></br>
                    </blockquote>
                    </br>
                    <h3> What is FOVEA's secret ingredient?</h3></br>
                    <blockquote>
                        The omnipresent material in all our products is the incredibly stunning elytron. The elytron is the protective part of wings of many insects. <i>Sternocera aequisignata</i>, a.k.a. the Jewel Bettle, is the insect from which our elytra our harvested. These elytra are mainly green and their strong red/copper or blue tints are revealed when light shines upon them, in a magical explosion of colors.</br></br>
                        Since each piece of jewelry has its own elytra, each item is unique! Admire the photo gallery on our website and see how the colors vary based on where the light comes from!</br></br>
                        The reason why these colors are so vivid and shiny is because they are not from pigments. The physical structure of the elytra itself is a mesh-like structure which the natural light goes through to be separated in red, gold, copper, green, blue and purple shades. It is the exact same phenomenon happening when a rainbow appears, only in a wearable unique piece of jewelry! </br></br>
                    </blockquote>
                    </br>
                    <h3> How was the name of the brand found? What does "FOVEA" mean?</h3></br>
                    <blockquote>
                        Because our collections are so colorful, we wanted to find a name to represent our products in harmony with them. The fovea is the precise part of the eye where all the light is perceived and where all details get sublimated.</br></br>
                        We believe that our products, when seen through individuals' fovea, will stun and appeal them!
                    </blockquote>

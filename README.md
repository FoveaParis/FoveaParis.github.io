## FoveaParis.github.io
This repo contains the website developed for FOVEA business.

## Hosting strategy
2018-09-03: jserizay.site/Business  
2018-10-16: migrated to github pages from Fovea account ([https://foveaparis.github.io](https://foveaparis.github.io))  
2018-10-16: linked github pages to a new domain ([https://foveaparis.com](https://foveaparis.com))  

As of 2018-10-17, the only place where the website is hosted (and backed-up) is github. The formal link is [https://foveaparis.github.io](https://foveaparis.github.io), but a domain (purchased through Namecheap.com) is also functional: [https://foveaparis.com](https://foveaparis.com).  
  
Site should be live, definitely [here](https://foveaparis.github.io) and maybe [here](https://foveaparis.com).

## TO DO list:
* Change button style ('Order now')  
* ~~Add top ribbon mentionning discount~~  
* Add FB/Instagram buttons
